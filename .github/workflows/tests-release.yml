  # STEP 1 - NPM Audit

  # Before we even test a thing we want to have a clean audit! Since this is
  # sufficient to be done using the lowest node version, we can easily use
  # a fixed one:

  audit:
    name: NPM Audit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '12'
    - run: npm audit --production # no audit for dev dependencies

  # STEP 2 - basic unit tests

  # This is the standard unit tests as we do in the basic tests for every PR

  # STEP 3 - Integration tests

  # cover the closest ones, like adapters and examples.
